# Binary-Tree-File-Explorer-System
This file explorer is a Python CLI simulating a file system with a binary tree. Users create/navigate directories/files, store content in `fs_storage`, and save structure in `filesystem.json`. Commands like `mkdir`, `touch`, `write` manage it. Concept: mimic a real file system with tree-based organization.
