# Binary-Tree-File-Explorer-System
The file explorer system is a Python-based command-line tool that simulates a file system using a binary tree data structure. It allows users to create, navigate, and manage directories and files, mimicking a real file system. The system is open for anyone to use, with a single-user interface where you issue commands like `init` to set up a root directory, `mkdir` to create directories, `touch` to make files, `write` to add multi-line content, and `read` to view file contents. Navigation is handled with `cd` for changing directories, `pwd` to show the current path, and `tree` to display the entire structure.

The core concept is to represent a file system hierarchically using a binary tree, where each node is a directory or file. Directories can have subdirectories (left child) and files (right child), enabling organized storage. File contents are saved as actual files in a `fs_storage` directory, mirroring the virtual structure (e.g., `/myroot/docs/notes.txt` becomes `fs_storage/myroot/docs/notes.txt`). The tree structure, without file contents, is persisted in `filesystem.json` for continuity across sessions.

This design combines in-memory tree operations with disk storage, offering a lightweight, educational simulation of file system mechanics. Users interact via a prompt showing the current path, using relative or absolute paths for flexibility. Itâ€™s single-user, with no authentication, making it accessible but limited to one operator at a time. The system supports multi-line file input and persistent storage, ideal for learning about tree-based data structures and file system concepts.
